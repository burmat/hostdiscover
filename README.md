# hostdiscover

Perform basic host discovery using Nmap in an effort to gain a rough idea of live hosts.

Put your full scope (hostnames, IPs, network ranges, etc.) into a file called 'fullscope.txt' and execute this script.

e.g.
```
# cat fullscope.txt

11.22.33.44/24
4.5.6.7/29
burmat.local
1.2.3.4
burmat.co
www.burm.at
```
